javax.servlet.http 
Interface HttpSession

Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page request or visit to a Web site and to store information about that user.

The servlet container uses this interface to create a session between an HTTP client and an HTTP server. 
The session persists for a specified time period, across more than one connection or page request from the user.
A session usually corresponds to one user, who may visit a site many times. 
The server can maintain a session in many ways such as using cookies or rewriting URLs.
