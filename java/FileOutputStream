 설명
 A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a File or to a FileDescriptor. 
 Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying platform. Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened for writing by only one FileOutputStream (or other file-writing object) at a time. 
 In such situations the constructors in this class will fail if the file involved is already open.

FileChannel	getChannel()
Returns the unique FileChannel object associated with this file output stream.

FileDescriptor	getFD()
Returns the file descriptor associated with this stream.

void	write(byte[] b)
Writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to this file output stream.

void	write(byte[] b, int off, int len)
